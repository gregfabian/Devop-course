The error **"advertise address must be a non-zero IP address or network interface (with optional port number)"** occurs because Docker requires a valid and reachable IP address or a network interface for the `--advertise-addr` flag, and `host.docker.internal` is not always accepted in this context.

However, you can still use `host.docker.internal` indirectly or configure a valid IP address. Here's how to proceed:

---

### **Step 1: Use a Valid IP Address for `--advertise-addr`**

1. **Find the Docker Desktop IP**:
   - You can try using Docker Desktop's internal IP directly, which is typically reachable in the local network.
   - Run the following to inspect the Docker Desktop network settings:
     ```bash
     docker network inspect bridge
     ```
     Look for the **Gateway** field in the output. This will be the IP you can use as the `--advertise-addr`.

     Example:
     ```json
     {
       "Name": "bridge",
       "Id": "abcd1234...",
       "Created": "2021-01-01T12:00:00.000000000Z",
       "Scope": "local",
       "Driver": "bridge",
       "EnableIPv6": false,
       "IPAM": {
         "Driver": "default",
         "Config": [
           {
             "Subnet": "172.17.0.0/16",
             "Gateway": "172.17.0.1"
           }
         ]
       },
       ...
     }
     ```

2. **Initialize Swarm with the Gateway IP**:
   - Using the IP from the `Gateway` field, you can now initialize the Swarm:
     ```bash
     docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.17.0.1
     ```

   Replace `172.17.0.1` with the actual gateway IP from your `docker network inspect bridge` output.

---

### **Step 2: Use `host.docker.internal` with the Correct Context**

If you're trying to use `host.docker.internal` from within a Docker container or from WSL2, you can still use `host.docker.internal` for communication between your container and Docker Desktop services.

However, when initializing the Swarm manager on Docker Desktop, Docker expects a specific, non-loopback IP address, not a hostname. Therefore, try to follow the previous step using an explicit IP address.

---

### **Step 3: Use `0.0.0.0` for Universal Access**

If you donâ€™t want to specify a specific IP address, you can use `0.0.0.0`, which binds the manager to all available network interfaces:

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 0.0.0.0
```

This will allow Docker to use any interface, though it's less restrictive. If you're on a local machine and are comfortable with this configuration, this can simplify the process.

---

### **Final Notes:**

- After initializing the Swarm manager using a valid IP address or `0.0.0.0`, you can continue the process of joining worker nodes with the provided token.
  
- The `advertise-addr` is critical for ensuring that other nodes can find and connect to the manager. If Docker Desktop's IP changes, you may need to reinitialize the swarm with a new IP.
